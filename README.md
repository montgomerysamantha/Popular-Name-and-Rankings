Program asks user for a birth year. Reads in a .txt file from the SSA of the most popular names for the particular year the user has entered. It then asks the user if they would like to search for a name, enter a rank (program will print out name at that rank),  or print out a list of the top (1-20, user's choice) names for that year.
